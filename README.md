# Group 13 project
Repository containing the code for Group 13's project in the DTU R for Bio Data Science course.

## Data
The data used in this project is from the article "_Comprehensive genomic profiles of small cell lung cancer_". The data can be found under "_Supplementary Data_" at the following link:
https://www.nature.com/articles/nature14664#Sec35

Once the supplementary data is downloaded in the form of a `.xlsx`file, it should be renamed to `raw_data.xlsx` and put in the folder `data/_raw` in order for getting running the script in the `R` folder.
